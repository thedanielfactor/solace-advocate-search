# Initial examination

## Fix errors and get to a baseline.

### 1. yearsOfExperience.includes not a function error:

`Page.tsx` is trying to call .includes() on advocate.yearsOfExperience, but according to the database schema in 
`src/db/schema.ts`, yearsOfExperience is defined as an integer, not a string. The .includes() method only works on 
strings and arrays. The fix is to convert the yearsOfExperience to a string before calling .includes()

### 2. Missing Uniue Keys.  

`Page.tsx` should have unique ids on elements created in an array or loop.  Adding unique keys:
- Advocate loop add `advocate.id` as the key.
- Advodate specialties loop, add unique key using `advocate.id` and the specialty index.

### 3. Fix issue with server found during manual build.

`src/app/api/seed/route.ts` was not validating DB before calling insert.

### 4. Hydration error during load.  

During server-side rendering, the table was empty (no advocates data). When the client-side JavaScript ran, it 
immediately tried to render the table with data. This created a mismatch between server and client rendering
By adding the loading state and conditional rendering, the server and client both render the same initial state 
(loading message) Only after the data is fetched does the table render This ensures consistent rendering between 
server and client.

1. Added loading state: Added an isLoading state that starts as true and becomes false after the data is fetched
2. Conditional rendering: The table only renders after the data is loaded, preventing hydration mismatches

### 5. TypeScript Strict Mode and Comprehensive Type Definitions

#### Enhanced TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
- **Enabled strict mode** (was already enabled)
- **Added additional strict checks**:
  - `noImplicitAny`: Prevents implicit `any` types
  - `noImplicitReturns`: Ensures all code paths return a value
  - `noImplicitThis`: Prevents implicit `this` usage
  - `noUnusedLocals`: Flags unused local variables
  - `noUnusedParameters`: Flags unused function parameters
  - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`: Stricter optional property handling
  - `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`: Safer array/object access

#### Centralized Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)
Created a comprehensive types file with:
- **API Response Types**: `ApiResponse<T>` for consistent API responses
- **Domain Types**: `Advocate` interface with proper nullable handling
- **Component Props Types**: `SearchBarProps`, `AdvocateTableProps`, etc.
- **Event Handler Types**: `InputChangeHandler`, `ButtonClickHandler`, etc.
- **Utility Types**: `SearchFilters`, `AppError`, `LoadingState`, etc.

#### Improved Component Types (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- **Proper event handler types**: Added `InputChangeHandler` and `ButtonClickHandler`
- **Async/await pattern**: Replaced promise chains with modern async/await
- **Error handling**: Added proper try/catch with typed error handling
- **API response typing**: Used `ApiResponse<Advocate[]>` for type safety

#### Enhanced API Route Types (`src/app/api/*/route.ts`)
- **Request/Response typing**: Added proper Next.js request/response types
- **Error response consistency**: Standardized error responses with `ApiResponse<T>`
- **Database type safety**: Added proper type casting for database results
- **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up unused dependencies

#### Database Type Improvements (`src/db/index.ts`)
- **Better return types**: Changed from mock object to `PostgresJsDatabase | null`
- **Proper null handling**: Added null checks in API routes
- **Type safety**: Ensured database operations are properly typed

#### Code Quality
- **Maintainability**: Types serve as documentation
- **Refactoring safety**: TypeScript catches breaking changes
- **Industry standards**: Aligns with modern TypeScript best practices

#### Testing
- **TypeScript compilation**: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors
- **Development server**: Application runs without type issues
- **Runtime functionality**: All existing features work as expected

#### Industry Alignment
- **Modern TypeScript**: Uses latest TypeScript features and best practices
- **React patterns**: Proper event handler and component prop types
- **API standards**: Consistent response types and error handling
- **Database safety**: Type-safe database operations
